Point point1 = new ( 2, 3 );

public class Point

    int Y { get; }

        X = x;
        Y = y;

    public void PrintPoint() => Console.WriteLine($"X: {this.X}, Y: {this.Y}");

//X and Y are immutable by design here. Once the instance is initialized, the points are set and that makes sense logically for me until I add ways to move the point location.
